# Notes

we need to start doc-ing how this works!

# data

`pagesnav.yml` contains all the info to create side nav for sections of the site

`people-table.csv` is directory table

`recognitions-bookplates.csv` is faculty bookplate list

`UI-OAPF_FAQ.csv` is faq for OAPF

# tables

adding `table-id:` to yml front matter will load basic datatables dependencies and init datatable on the id.
